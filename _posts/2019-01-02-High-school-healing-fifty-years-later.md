excerpt: "“A sincere apology is strong medicine. One of the deepest wounds for many of us is the loss of dignity, the loss of the recognition of our inherent worth in the eyes of our peers. A sincere apology cancels the disrespect and reaffirms our worth. Even though it took more than 50 years, that’s what Bruce offered the two sisters who had been outcasts at their school.”"

<p>“They may forget what you said but they will never forget how you made them feel,” goes a wise old saying. The stronger the feeling, the more vividly we record the memory. When someone treats us really badly, our pain—and their guilt—can remain unresolved for decades. While we all know the past cannot be changed, the story of the Rys sisters, Kathleen and Lorraine, shows how forgiveness can change our relationship to it. </p>

<p>It all started in 1954 when the Rys family moved with their mother and father from the big city of Chicago to Monee, a small town of about 600 people on the Illinois prairie. Kathleen was in the 4th grade, Lorraine in the 3rd. Somehow these two girls became the outcasts and scapegoats of the school. Throughout the rest of elementary school, through junior high and continuing on <em>even after high school</em>, the sisters ran a seemingly endless gauntlet of slights, insults and ostracism. </p>

<p>“It was terrible, just terrible,” said Lorraine. “Somehow the whole entire school got against us. Not just one, not just two. The whole entire school. Not one person talked to us. Not one person wanted to get near us. It was like we had the plague or something.” </p>

<p>“They called us Risk instead of Rys,” Kathleen added. “We were the untouchables.” </p><p>They were ostracized outside class as well. No sleepovers, no dances, no clubs, no sports. “Nobody wanted us,” said Lorraine. “If we walked down the hall, all the kids would huddle on the other side and let us walk by ourselves…When we climbed the stairs to go to our other classes, if someone bumped into us, they’d run to the washroom to wash their hands.” They don’t recall a single other child ever speaking to them in kindness. </p>

<p>The hazing continued even after high-school graduation. Kathleen started working at the Illinois Central Railroad and was doing well for a few years. But then an old classmate joined her department and started bullying her again, and turning her coworkers against her.</p>

<p>The effects have been lasting especially for the eldest, Kathleen. The pain of being shunned stays “forever,” she says. “I still lack confidence. It takes an effort for me to talk to people, to hug somebody. That doesn’t come naturally.” In those days parents rarely intervened at school, and teachers likewise took a hands-off attitude to bullying, so the sisters had only each other. They’ve had trouble making friends ever since. Lorraine, the younger of the two, went on to marry and have children, but Kathleen never did. </p>

<p>So far, the other children at Monee Elementary School sound like a mean bunch, and so they might have been. Over the years, however, at least one of them has changed. Bruce Smit was in the same class as Kathleen. “My earliest recollection was in sixth grade, when you start changing classrooms. Everybody’s in the hallways and I would be with the other guys and see Kathleen walking down the hallway, her head down, holding her books, walking slowly. And all of us guys would be flat against the wall until she passed. Then we’d giggle and walk away…that’s the kind of memory that I have,” he said. “We were cruel, and for apparently no reason other than following the crowd.”</p>

<p>Smit went on to study medicine. In medical school, studying the art and science of healing, his conscience began to bother him. He began having vivid recollections of the cruelty he helped inflict on the sisters. His remorse increased as the years passed. He shared his feelings with his wife Tammy. “Bruce would just start to cry at times. He’d wonder what happened to the sisters, if they landed OK,” she said. </p>

<p>One day in the spring of 2018, after hearing Bruce fret about the sisters once again, Tammy decided to take action. Within a few hours she googled Kathleen’s address and found Lorraine’s daughter on Facebook. Tammy offered to set up a meeting. “We were so afraid to meet him,” Kathleen said. But despite understandable fears, the sisters agreed. Bruce didn’t realize it then, but just the fact that he felt sorry was all it took for the sisters to forgive him. </p>

<p>“I forgave him immediately,” Kathleen said.</p>

<p>“Of course I forgave him,” added Lorraine. “How could I not?”</p><p>The meeting took place at a Panera. It started off uncomfortably, with the former roles of bully and victim seemingly reversed. Now Bruce was the shy and timid one, unable to bring himself to sit face to face with the sisters. Instead he sat nervously in a corner with his wife Tammy, a few tables over from Kathleen and Lorraine. Bruce was visibly distressed, or seemed so to Lorraine. She cut the tension by shouting out, “I forgive you!” echoed quickly by her sister Kathleen. </p>

<p>Bruce broke down in tears.</p><p>“I’m so ashamed, so embarrassed. But I’m so happy they’re still here and that I can finally apologize. It’s cathartic,” Bruce said.</p>

<p>The three have met many times in the year since that first tense encounter. Their conversations often return to those early days.</p><p>“I do feel better now,” Kathleen said. “To face it and just to let it go. For him to admit that it happened. I carried it for so long.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I feel better,” Bruce said. “I still carry the guilt. But I have a different perspective on it now. I don’t wonder anymore where they are and how they turned out.</p><p>“But the guilt still haunts me. I think about these incidences so long ago and how they affected their lives. It helped to mold them and make them who they are. I wonder what might have been, what they missed in life,” he said.</p>

<p>A sincere apology is strong medicine. One of the deepest wounds for many of us is the loss of dignity, the loss of the recognition of our inherent worth in the eyes of our peers. A sincere apology cancels the disrespect and reaffirms our worth. Even though it took more than 50 years, that’s what Bruce offered.</p>

<p>As we all know, however, some apologies never arrive. Bruce is the only classmate from that tiny town to express any remorse. So the task of restoring the recognition of our worth falls back on our own shoulders. We always have the option of stewing over it and holding a grudge, seeking status through victimhood. Or we can refocus on the good in our lives and on the future, restoring our dignity through our own attitudes and actions. If and when an apology arrives, then it can become a new more positive memory, and possibly, a renewed friendship.</p>

<p>Many of us will see ourselves in Bruce. We belittled others, we took advantage of their weaknesses for sport, we denied by word or deed their worth and value. Did our actions diminish us as well? How can we become whole again? Not everyone can find their victims, and not everyone wants to hear from an old tormentor. But what would happen if we just acknowledged to one other person what we did, and how it was wrong? Would it make a difference for you? For someone else?</p>

<p>The whirligig of time brings to each of us many roles in life’s drama: now a saint, now a sinner, now a reveler, now a mourner. What role we play next might be a surprise, so the less we feel burdened by the past the more freedom we’ll have. What about your past could you be more comfortable with? What lingers unresolved, and what difference would it make if you were able to resolve it? Could forgiveness play some role?</p>

<p>It took both Bruce and the Rys sisters about the same amount of courage to show up at the restaurant that day last spring. What part of your past—even a very small part—do you have courage enough to start resolving now? </p>
