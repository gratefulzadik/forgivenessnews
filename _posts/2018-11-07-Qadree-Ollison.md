excerpt: "“I questioned myself for a long time…wondering why I didn’t hate you. I wondered why I felt just as bad for your family as I did my own. I thought for a long time this made me a bad person. I thought I should hate the person that killed my brother and I couldn’t bring myself to do it.”"

<p>“Wall-busting power back” Qadree Ollison finished his college football career at the University of Pittsburgh earlier this year, and was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in the fifth round. Off the gridiron, Qadree also happens to be a powerhouse of forgiveness. In August of 2017, his older brother LeRowne Harris was murdered in cold blood. The killer was Denzel Lewis, a friend Qadree had known since middle school. During the time Qadree was giving his all to sports and school, LeRowne and Denzel were taking a less promising path involving drugs and violence.</p>

<p>Lewis was convicted and sentenced last fall. Wayne Ollison, Qadree’s father, drove Qadree to the courthouse on the day of the sentencing. On the way they had an interesting conversation. Given the circumstances, they had every right, according to conventional wisdom, to ask for the stiffest penalty for Denzel Lewis. Qadree’s father fully intended to do that. But Qadree had a different way of thinking. </p>

<p>“How would you feel if I didn’t hate Denzel?” Qadree asked his dad.</p>

<p>In the weeks before the sentencing, he found he couldn’t stay angry at Denzel at all, and it made him wonder if there was something wrong with him. Instead of being kept up at night by thoughts of anger and revenge, he was being kept up by worry that his forgiveness of Denzel somehow made him a bad person. In a letter prepared for Denzel’s sentencing, Qadree wrote:&nbsp; </p>

<p>“When I heard what happened I was devastated, like most would be when they hear that their brother’s life was taken. During that time though, I didn’t feel an ounce of hate for whoever had done it. I questioned myself for a long time, staying up all night and wondering why I didn’t hate you. I wondered why I felt just as bad for your family as I did my own. I was in unbelievable shock when I found out who it was that did this, and didn’t believe it…I thought for a long time this made me a bad person. I thought I should hate the person that killed my brother and I couldn’t bring myself to do it. </p>

<p>“The entire time my family was grieving over the loss of my brother, I was worried about both parties, wondering how your mother felt or your father felt. I have this deep belief that every life is precious no matter what they do. Even if they murder someone, that life is still precious…</p>

<p>“Now, here I am, and I have this choice to hate you or not. I choose not to. I don’t hate you Denzel. I hate what you did, most certainly. But I still think your life is as precious as the next person’s.” </p><p>The judge was touched by Qadree’s words, telling Qadree’s father “You should be proud of him.” But the judge agreed more with Mr. Ollison. He called the crime “an assassination more than a murder,” and gave Lewis the maximum sentence of 25 years.</p>

<p>The fact that Qadree was worried that his forgiving nature was somehow wrong is a clear sign that our culture does not value forgiveness the same way it values beauty, bravery, creativity, or grit. What would my life, or your life be like if we could take Qadree’s perspective? What would our culture be like? </p>

<p>Those who forgive transgressions often face criticism and rejection…even from people who had nothing to do with the situation. We can’t stop others from criticizing what they don’t understand or can’t accept. But let’s not criticize ourselves for seeking freedom and peace. </p>
