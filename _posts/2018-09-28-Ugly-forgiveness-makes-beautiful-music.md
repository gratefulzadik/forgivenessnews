<p>Brandi Carlile named her 2018 album <em>By the Way, I Forgive You</em> for the all-too-common practice of offering forgiveness (pseudo-forgiveness, actually) as a way to hurt someone while appearing virtuous. </p>

<p>Carlile knows what real forgiveness is about: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Forgiveness is so radical and so filthy, and it gets made out to be such a casual concept, when really it might be one of the deepest things that we do as humans — to forgive for real deep hurts. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>By the Way, I Forgive You</em> received three (out of a possible six) nominations at the Americana Awards this year. Unfortunately it didn’t win in any categories, but nonetheless it’s great not only to see forgiveness explored in music, but also to receive at least some recognition. Thanks, Brandi! </p>
