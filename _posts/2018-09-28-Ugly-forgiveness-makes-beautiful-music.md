<p>Brandi Carlile named her 2018 album <em>By the Way, I Forgive You</em> for the all-too-common practice of offering forgiveness (pseudo-forgiveness, actually) as a way to hurt someone while appearing virtuous. </p>

<p>Carlile knows what real forgiveness is about: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Forgiveness is so radical and so filthy, and it gets made out to be such a casual concept, when really it might be one of the deepest things that we do as humans — to forgive for real deep hurts.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>By the Way, I Forgive You</em> received three (out of a possible six) nominations at the Americana Awards this year. It didn’t win in any categories, but nonetheless it’s great to see forgiveness explored in a popular song in an honest way, and for that song to receive such recognition. Way to go, Brandi! </p>
