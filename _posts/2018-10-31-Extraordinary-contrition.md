<p>On March 12, 2015, Larry Garwood of Island Park, NY put in a long Thursday at work, then got in his car and headed home. Just after midnight, a drunk driver crossed into his lane and struck his car head-on, killing him. Larry's widow, Kim Garwood, 64, struggled with the terrible loss, with being alone, and with the financial consequences of losing her husband.</p>

<p>Natalia Simons, 39, of Kings Park, NY was the drunk driver. With her blood alcohol at .18%, twice the legal limit, she simply wandered into the oncoming lane in front of Larry Garwood. Booked on a misdemeanor charge of drunk driving, she pleaded guilty and posted bond.</p>

<p>At the time of the accident, Kim called for harsher penalties for DWI. “I just feel this drunken driving has to stop…and I believe she belongs in jail. She took him from me. She took him from my family. He’s gone.”</p>

<p>Kim got her wish. On September 18, 2018, Natalia Simons was sentenced to four years in prison for aggravated vehicular manslaughter. </p>

<p>But now Kim is ready to forgive. Maybe it’s because of the time Natalia will spend in jail. But it may also be because of what Natalia has been doing since that tragic night. </p>

<p>Ms. Simons admitted from the beginning that she had been drinking. Then she pleaded guilty to the harsher charges. She acknowledges that the Garwood family won’t be made whole again no matter how much time she spends in prison.</p>

<p>“There is not a day that goes by when I don’t think about what happened and the pain that I’ve caused,” Natalia said at her sentencing hearing. “I’m very sorry for that. I don’t expect forgiveness. I just hope one day you can accept my apology.”</p>

<p>During the year she spent in jail awaiting her sentence, she helped fellow inmates think about the impact of their crimes and how to prevent drunk driving. She also promised to raise money for funeral expenses of drunken-driving victims and to train bar and restaurant employees to recognize signs of intoxication. She fasts on the 13th day of every month in Larry Garwood’s memory. Her lawyer says he’s never seen a defendant so regretful for what she did and so eager to make amends. </p>

<p>Natalia’a attitude seems to have affected Kim Garwood. “I have come to realize this was not intentional,” Kim said at the sentencing. “I need to forgive her. I hope she does as she said she would do, and never drinks and drives again.”</p>

<p>Contrition is a way of opening your heart to someone you’ve harmed. Forgiveness is a way of opening your heart to someone who’s harmed you. Kim Garwood lost her husband and nothing can completely fill that void. And there stands Natalia Simons, whose humility prevents her from hoping for forgiveness, whose contrition, no matter how deep or sincere, can ever fill that void. But maybe it can make it less lonely.</p>

<p>“I just hope that she keeps her promise in keeping Larry’s name alive,” Kim said at the close of the hearing. “Hopefully our lives will be better.” </p>
