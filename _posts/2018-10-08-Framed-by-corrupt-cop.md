excerpt: "“If I was just so angry, I would have been so consumed. That wouldn’t have gotten me anywhere. I would have just been another mad, black guy in prison for something that he didn’t do.”"

<p>Scott Lewis is a paragon of persistence, optimism, and above all, forgiveness. The new documentary <em><a href="https://www.mattnadel.com/120years" target="_blank" >120 Years</em></a> tells how Vincent Raucci, the notoriously corrupt New Haven detective, framed Lewis for a double murder. Lewis was sentenced to 120 years in prison, but used his time in jail to study law. He spent over 19 years fighting setbacks, corruption, and incompetence in the Connecticut courts before getting his conviction overturned. Most of that time he worked alone, writing appeals and briefs on whatever paper he could find, with no more resources than the prison library.</p>

<p>Forgiveness was the first and most important choice Lewis made.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The fact that I’m angry and staying stuck in anger isn’t going to get me where I need to be or where I want to go so I kind of channeled that anger into more of an emotion of determination.&nbsp;To win my freedom.&nbsp;To get justice.&nbsp;And I continue to want to live and to touch people’s lives in a different type of way.”</p>
  <p>—Scott Lewis</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His compassion leaves him with no bitterness toward Raucci, the man who falsely accused him, lied under oath, and threatened witnesses at his trial. “I know what it feels like to do things you regret. And that’s gotta suck.”</p>

<p>Note that Lewis’s forgiveness does not include any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Saying the mistakes of the courts or Detective Raucci are OK in any way</p></li>
  <li><p>Giving up on justice</p></li>
  <li><p>Making himself weak or vulnerable</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Lewis proves to us that choosing what we do with our anger can change our life for better, or for worse. Choosing to forgive rather than ruminate or take vengeance creates the possibility to use anger for something truly good.</p>
