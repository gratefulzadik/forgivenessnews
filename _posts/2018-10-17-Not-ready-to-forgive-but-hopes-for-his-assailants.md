<p>When Simon Luck, Paul Samuels, and Anselm Legemah attempted to steal the car Michael Watson was riding in, they sprayed Watson and his friend Leonard Ballack in the face with ammonia. Watson got caught in the seat belt, his body hanging out the car door and his head scraping the pavement as the carjackers drove away. Watson is a former British boxing legend who suffered a near-fatal brain injury at the peak of his career in 1992. He says this attack was “worse than the boxing injuries.” </p>

<p>The attackers were recently sentenced and are now in jail. Watson understandably wants justice to be served. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I still can’t forgive them. They nearly killed me, I could have been left blind. What they did, they are monsters, demons.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But he is obviously a man with tremendous empathy and compassion. Despite the cold and calculated attack, he appreciates the desperation of their background and believes they can change their lives:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I feel quite sorry for them. They never had a chance. If I had grown up in their position I wouldn’t have achieved what I had. I’d like to visit them in jail, maybe not immediately, and I would ask them why they had chosen this path. I’d want to encourage them, give them inspiration. They need to be led on the right path, we need to give them role models. I’d tell them, ‘Don’t give up hope, believe in yourselves.’” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The urge to understand where the offender is coming from and how they made the choices they did may be one of the most healing of urges, because it has the potential to heal both the victim and the offender. The simple act of asking such a question implies a humanity that the offender may not feel entitled to. This just might be the spark that liberates them and sets them on the journey to repentance, as it did when <a href="https://forgivenessnewsnetwork.com/2018/8/23/Forgiveness-Finds-a-Strange-New-Home">Mary Johnson visited Oshea Israel</a> in prison.</p>

<p>Some think that forgiveness is only for the benefit of the victim. But that’s clearly not always the case. </p>
