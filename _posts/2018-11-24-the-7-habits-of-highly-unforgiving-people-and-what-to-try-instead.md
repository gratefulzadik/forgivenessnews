<p>As a highly unforgiving person myself, I can tell you that the habits of unforgiving people lead to suffering as surely as flames fly upward. Holding a grudge keeps us in a chronic state of stress, and every moment of resentment about the past steals a moment of hope from our future. </p>

<p>But even the least forgiving can change. Forgiveness can be learned. I believe we can understand unforgiveness as a set of habits. A habit is just a behavior we have repeated so many times that it has become automatic. And habits can be replaced! As long as we’re alive we have the chance to change our behaviors and attitudes. </p>

<p>I have found that changing an unforgiving habit even a little, even though it may go against my every instinct, has been worth the discomfort. By the same token, many of us unforgiving people have deep unresolved hurts from the distant past. As I try more forgiving behaviors, some of those feelings have begun to surface. With forgiveness I have a chance to finally feel them and let them go. It’s changed my perspective on myself and those who’ve hurt me, and made me feel just a little more whole. And it’s great to feel more whole. </p>

<p>What better way to learn a new habit than to follow a good example? Highly forgiving people have their own habits that support them in forgiving more often and more readily than the rest of us do. Those habits can be developed, like any other habit, with practice and attention. Let’s take a look at the habits of forgiveness and unforgiveness side-by-side:</p>

<h2> 7 Habits of Highly Unforgiving People </h2> 

<div class="indented-list">
  <h4>We take life too personally.</h4>
    <p>And when it doesn’t go our way we: </p>      
        <ul>
          <li>Assume that we have been singled out somehow for the bad behavior of others or random misfortunes. </li>
          <li>Believe that we’re alone, that there’s something unique about our situation: “no one else has suffered what I have.”</li>
        </ul> 
        
        <p>Taking life too personally is the genesis of unforgiveness. Everything else follows from this. </p> 
  
  <h4>We assume the worst about the transgressor</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>We think, “They must have meant to hurt me this way.”</li>
          <li>We blind ourselves to any evidence that they have ever been good, or that we ourselves have ever been blameworthy. </li>
          <li>We cast them as a scheming villain and ourselves as an innocent victim. </li>
        </ul> 
  
  <h4>We blame the transgressor for our suffering and distress</h4>
    <p>And we demand they be punished for it. In order to do this we: </p>      
        <ul> 
          <li>Ignore or dismiss mitigating circumstances or alternative explanations. </li>
          <li>Ignore any role our choices might have played in contributing to the outcome and how we feel about it. </li>
        </ul>
  
  <h4>We soothe ourselves with fantasies of revenge.</h4>
    <p>Most people feel distressed, hurt, and angry about transgressions. But we insist that the world be safe and fair to us at all times. Transgressions lead us to an awareness of our vulnerability that we find hard to accept.</p>
    
    <p>We feel ashamed of being vulnerable, and even more angry at the transgressor for exposing it. So we imagine putting the offender in the same vulnerable and painful position.</p>
  
  <h4>We disrupt our own grieving process</h4>
    <p>Some of us stay stuck in grieving while others won’t allow ourselves to grieve until somebody “pays.” That is, until they admit guilt, accept punishment, and return everything to the way it was before.</p>
    <p>Sometimes it works. But it’s our own future we hold hostage in the meantime. </p>
  
  <h4>We obsess over our losses</h4>
    <p>The hopelessness of changing the past bleeds over into our beliefs about the future. Consequently, we:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Minimize the good things in our lives</li>
      <li>Turn away from love and support</li>
      <li>Stop working toward our hopes</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>With neither works nor faith to feed them, our dreams wither.</p>
        
  <h4>We avoid those we are angry with</h4>
      <p>Sometimes we need time to recover and heal. Sometimes we rightly fear more injuries. But beyond that, unforgiving people are looking for a covert way to:</p>
        <ul> 
          <li>Set a boundary with that we don’t know how to set more directly.</li>
          <li>“Resolve” the conflict by ending the relationship. </li>
        </ul>

<h2> 7 Habits of Highly Forgiving People </h2> 

<div class="indented-list">
  <h4>We try not to take life personally.</h4>
    <p>We accept that life can be unpredictable and won’t always go our way. But our attitude is, “It’s not all about me.”</p>
    <p>When bad things happen, we remind ourselves: </p>
    
      <ul> 
        <li>We’re not alone. No matter how big or small our loss, many others have experienced the same thing. </li>
        <li>Our pain is real, but it does not make us special. Every human being has suffered, some intensely. </li>
      </ul> 
  
  <h4>We try not to leap to judgment.</h4>
    <p>We tend to believe that: </p>  
    <ul> 
      <li>Most people mean no harm. </li>
      <li>We have much in common with the offender. We understand that “It could have been me running that red light,” “He must have thought that was the only choice he had.” </li>
      <li>We don't know the whole story. The offender’s perspective is worth understanding. </li>
      <li>Even if they meant to harm us, blame only binds us to the injustice. Only compassion can free us. We wonder what kind of life they must be living to want to hurt someone else. What must they have suffered to become so callous or cruel? Such people deserve compassion as much as we do. </li>
    </ul>
  
  <h4>We take responsibility for our own experience.</h4>
    <p>We understand that we alone control how we respond to transgressions. We exercise what Viktor Frankl calls <em>“the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”</em> </p>
    <p>We acknowledge that we have sensitivities and triggers like everyone else, so we determine whether our feelings really fit this situation. The transgressor is responsible for what they did, and we are responsible for managing our thoughts, feelings, and attitudes about it.</p>
  
  <h4>We soothe ourselves by stepping back to take care of our wounds.</h4>
    <p>We know we may not make the best decisions when we’re still angry and in pain. We move, breathe, create, connect to friends and family, hibernate, or whatever works to calm ourselves. </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>We’re more accepting of our vulnerability, knowing we share it with every other human. </li>
      <li>We find help when it gets too much. </li>
    </ul>
    
  <h4>We allow ourselves to grieve and to mourn whatever we’ve lost.</h4>
    <p>Grieving and mourning take their own path, and we don’t rush it. We want justice and work for it. But we accept the possibility that justice may never arrive. Even if it does, we accept that our life may never again be the way it was.</p>
  
  <h4>We try to keep our pain in perspective.</h4>
    <p>We shift our focus to things we can still be glad about. We celebrate the good things still remaining, the good things we remember from the past, and the good things possible in the future. The loss of some hopes makes us realize how important it is to keep our other hopes alive.</p>
  
  <h4>We try for reconciliation</h4> 
    <p>But not at the expense of our safety or sanity. If it’s safe to do so, we try to work things out with the offender directly. We tell them how we were affected and listen to their perspective. Whether the relationship continues or not, we remain open to positive changes.</p>

<p>Maybe that seems like a long list. What stands out to you? What habit are you most curious about? What might you notice if you exchanged an unforgiving habit for a forgiving one? </p>

<p><strong>An exploration: </strong></p>
<p>The first and most powerful step in changing a habit is simply to become more aware of it. The key to awareness lies in simply observing. Here’s a way to start:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pick one habit, perhaps the one you had the strongest reaction to. It doesn’t matter if it’s a habit you want to quit or one that you want to adopt, as long as it has your interest.</li>
  <li>Where and when do you notice this behavior? Begin to notice it within and around you, not just in yourself, but in anyone. These habits are everywhere, so whatever you picked, there are people around you who have that behavior.</li>
  <li>Don’t judge. Don’t analyze. Just notice. Don’t treat it as a problem to be solved, but just as something worth noticing.</li>
  <li>How does it feel when you see it? How are others in the situation feeling? How are others responding?</li>
  <li>Whatever you notice, discuss it with a friend or just write it down.</li>
  <li>Check your notes from time to time, or review with your friends.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it. If you observe regularly, the seeds of change will germinate. Your brain will naturally begin to integrate what you’ve observed, and it will begin to show you new opportunities to behave differently where you once flew on autopilot.</p>

<p>Sharing your experiment with your friends and family will definitely improve your results. Tell them what you’ve noticed, and see where the discussion goes. Ask them to help you spot the habits, and combine your observations.</p>
