<p>No one is an island—even serial killers have families. When an FBI detective revealed to Kerri Rawson that her father, Dennis Rader, was the “B.T.K.” killer who had murdered 10 in Wichita, Kansas over the course of 31 years, she came undone. “I went into physical shock…after I was notified, for about five days—shaking, not being able to eat, not sleeping, falling apart.” Like many sociopaths Rader lived a double life, meticulously isolating one from the other. The loving, overprotective father who had taken Rawson camping and fishing, it turns out, was also an unfeeling monster who tortured and murdered women and children just like her. </p>

<p>If anyone <em>is</em> an island, it may be the child of a serial killer. In her new book <em>A Serial Killer’s Daughter</em>, Rawson writes about the shame, isolation and guilt she experienced in the years following her father’s arrest, and the forgiveness she’s been able to find for him. In an interview with CBC Radio, she summarizes some of the key points we all need to remember about forgiveness:</p>

<p>“I think people need to understand that when you’re forgiving someone you’re not…you’re not saying whatever they’ve done is OK, because there’s nothing…nothing is OK about what my father did to those seven families. Nothing will ever be OK, and it’s not even my place to forgive that, that’s the families’ place. I’m trying to forgive what he’s done to <em>my</em> family and the betrayal.”</p>

<p>After his arrest in February of 2005, Rawson had written to her father often. “I wanted him to know I still loved him. You know I still loved the man I knew…the man that I can…talk to about the birds and the seasons and migration and the changing colors and that’s the man that I know and love. I don’t know that other man. I don’t know BTK.” </p>

<p>One can imagine many ways that Rader betrayed his children: hypocrisy, lies, and secrets would be among the least. One of those betrayals became clear to Rawson just a few months later, at Rader’s sentencing in August, 2005. Rader had used his church, Boy Scout troop, and family not only to provide alibis for his crimes, but also to scout new targets and gain their trust. “After the sentencing, it came out that he had said in [his] confession that my family were…pawns in his game. And once I heard that I was done with my dad.” </p>

<p>Rawson stopped writing to him. “He could rot in hell after he said that,” she writes in her book. For the next seven years, she struggled with the betrayal and her anger ate away at her. “It was rotting in me, it was killing me…I needed to forgive, but I didn’t want to forgive.”</p>

<p>Rawson’s path to forgiveness was complicated by the intense publicity around her father’s crimes and the public shaming that followed on social media. The work of forgiveness is mostly private but strangers often feel they have a stake in the outcome, especially when the offender is a notorious serial killer. </p>

<p>“They automatically think because you’re related to this person, you’re obviously bad and you obviously hid something…I’m still dealing with it…today on social media because I’m talking and I’m being told, I don’t have the right to be a victim, I don’t have the right to suffer…People are telling me they want to throw me in a wood chipper, and my family and my kids, because of my dad.” It seems Rawson’s feelings about her father took a back seat to the forceful and intrusive judgments of strangers about <em>her</em>. </p>

<p>The crush of publicity surrounding the arrest and trial overwhelmed Rawson and her family. The judgments of strangers and the shock of finding out her father was not who she thought shook her confidence in her own identity. Was she somehow, as all the haters said, no more and no less than the daughter of a monster? And what could she do about it now? With no way to influence how the public saw her, she responded by hiding. She had married and was living in Michigan, so she was able to hide it from friends there. She avoided going back to Kansas except when her mother needed help. </p>

<p>No one she knew suspected who her father was. But hiding wasn’t enough. She needed help, as anyone would, to deal with her father’s crimes and betrayal. Except for her husband, she was alone. Then one day Rawson heard the story of a rape survivor who had forgiven the rapist, not for his sake, but to lighten her own suffering. The story touched a nerve with Rawson. The idea that forgiveness could be a way out of her isolation intrigued her. She talked about the survivor’s story for days with everyone she knew. Finally she decided she needed to come out of hiding, to let the people in her life know who she was and what she was struggling with, no matter how they might judge her. </p>

<p>One Sunday in August of 2012, more than seven years after her father’s conviction, she announced to the members of her women’s group at church that she was the daughter of a serial killer, and that she had not forgiven him. No one shamed her this time. She got support and new perspectives. One friend in particular, Marijo Swanson, suggested a way to re-frame her situation that she found very useful. What her father had done was beyond her control, Swanson pointed out. But how she responded was up to her. “If we choose not to forgive or not work at healing from the betrayal,” Swanson told her, “we continue to give the other person power to control us and our feelings.” </p>

<p>Later that fall, Rawson cracked her tibia and was laid up for a few weeks at home. She spent the time sorting out her thoughts and feelings about her situation, her anger, and what she was learning about forgiveness.</p><p>“Finally in December of 2012 I was coming home from a movie and it [forgiveness] basically just washed over me,” she said. She cried so much she had to pull the car over. Her tension was gone, her anger at her father had fallen away.</p>

<p>“And so I rushed home and I wrote my dad a really long letter about my life and his grandkids that he would never see and the life he would never have.” </p>

<p>She ended the letter with this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I have come to terms with what happened with you and laid it to rest. I am never going to understand it but I forgive you.</p>
  <p>I don’t know if I will ever be able to make it for a visit but know that I love you and hope to see you in heaven some day.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to her husband Darian, sending the letter changed Kerri.</p>

<p>“Before she forgave him, she thought of herself as BTK’s daughter. But as soon as she forgave him, she was Kerri again.”</p>

<p>Rawson has no illusions about her father. She’s perfectly aware that he is just as capable of evil now as he ever was. As with compassion, we who forgive must establish boundaries and deliver consequences if those boundaries are violated.</p>

<p>“When you forgive somebody it doesn’t also mean you have to be back in relationship with them. I have very strict boundaries with my father to protect myself and my family. I still love him, but he can’t be a very large part of my life,” she says. “I have only ever written him. He could potentially talk to me on the phone. But then he would have my phone number, and I haven’t ever wanted him to have it. I’ve never been comfortable enough to talk to him on the phone or see him at the prison.”</p>

<p>Some may find it very uncomfortable to think that a cold-blooded sociopath like Dennis Rader might receive forgiveness from anybody. Is it even more uncomfortable to think that he’s received the forgiveness of a loving daughter?</p>

<p>There is a logic to forgiveness but to be honest, most of us don’t find it very compelling. We are moved instead by our own suffering and bewilderment. Forgiveness requires us to see more than we want to see, to overcome our simple reflexes and learn to see differently. Kerri Rawson had to acknowledge the grotesque horror of her father’s secret life, and she had to learn how to separate her own identity from her relationship to him. Her life is not all peaches and cream, even today. She still receives visits from depression, anxiety, and sleepless nights sometimes. But she is no longer alone, and no longer bitter.</p>

<p>What unpleasant facts might you need to acknowledge in order to forgive? What questions about who you are might you need to resolve? What might you need to ask for? If Kerri Rawson could do it, then perhaps so can all of us.</p>
