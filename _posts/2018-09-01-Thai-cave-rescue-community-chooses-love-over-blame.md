<p>The story of the Thai children stranded deep in a cave with their soccer coach gripped the world like few other stories. The mortal danger to the young children increasing with every passing hour, the difficulty of the rescue, and the mystery of why they got trapped generated enormous attention.<p>

<p>But another aspect of this event got much less attention: the forgiveness of the childrens’ parents toward the coach who led them into the cave and remained trapped with them.
Two weeks into the ordeal, amid lingering anguish and languishing hope, the parents sent the coach a note saying, “We want you to be relieved. Every dad and mom isn’t angry with you at all. And everyone understands and encourages you. Thank you for looking after the boys.”</p>
