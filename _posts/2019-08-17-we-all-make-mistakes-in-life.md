Anna Minten's story is not here because of the severity of her suffering, but because of the quality of her forgiveness. </p>

<p>Minten is at the center of a case that has caught national attention across Canada. Canadian law allows private citizens to grow up to four marijuana plants for their own purposes. The laws of British Columbia further specify that the plants should not be visible from a “public place.” </p>

<p>On July 28, off-duty Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Constable Faron Ling spotted three marijuana plants on Minten’s property, which was part of the Revelstoke Art &amp; Garden Tour. Despite the fact that the house is on a large lot in a rural location, and the plants were about 165 feet (50 meters) from the road, Constable Ling thought it was a violation. But rather than simply having a word with Minton to advise her that she was violating the new ordinance, Ling took another route. Over the next two days, he staked out the home and took pictures from across the street with a telephoto lens. With photos as evidence, he requested (and received) a search warrant. While Anna and her husband were away, Constable Ling and four other officers ransacked Anna’s home, took her mail, broke into her shed, and destroyed her marijuana plants. No charges have yet been filed.</p>

<p>Minten was angry at first. “They went everywhere. I feel violated. I feel hurt and mistreated. Their actions were unjustified…I feel like I am a good person and this is pretty ridiculous,” she said.</p>

<p>The small community of Revelstoke felt the same. The town responded with outrage and criticism of the RCMP for what many saw as unfair, heavy-handed, and arbitrary enforcement of the new marijuana laws. The outrage has spread across British Columbia and entered the national conversation through social media. Growing marijuana is very popular, especially in British Columbia, and the enforcement actions of the RCMP have shaken the public. But especially in Revelstoke, the relations between the RCMP and the community remain at a low. </p>

<p>So far, the RCMP have not relented. </p>

<p>Public outcry against the RCMP has been ugly on social media. In a move that sets her apart as a great example of forgiveness, Minten saw that the need for trust between the public and RCMP outweighs the particulars of her own case. This week Minten called on the community to stand down in their anger and find forgiveness: “As wrong as their actions may have been, please try not to hold onto anger. We all make mistakes in life. You only know, what you know.”</p>

<p>In a post on Facebook she continued, “I’m sure most of us would like to feel safe calling them if we needed them, and they taking on the job they have, would like you to feel safe calling them…At this point, with their latest actions, I pray for humility amongst them to apologize and begin their focus on re-establishing faith in the community and province.”</p><p>Can forgiveness, like other behaviors, be contagious? Can one public example provide a template and guide for others? We certainly hope so. </p>
