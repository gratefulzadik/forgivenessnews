<p>One danger of unforgiveness is that we become tainted by the same flaws and errors of those who harmed us. Their anger begets ours. Their callousness hardens our hearts. Their depravity inspires our revenge fantasy. </p>

<p>But when Clementa C. Pinckney, Cynthia Marie Graham Hurd, Susie Jackson, Ethel Lee Lance, Depayne Middleton-Doctor, Tywanza Sanders and Sharonda Coleman-Singleton lost their lives in 2015 when a white supremacist strode through Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. shooting everyone he saw, their congregation did not hold a grudge against him. Instead, just as they had that morning when he entered their church pretending to join them in their studies, they enveloped him in community and swathed him in forgiveness.</p>

<p>Dylann Roof has never repented. Convicted of the shootings, he remains in prison still promoting his race hatred.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I have no ill feelings about him, no anger or hatred. Forgiving him was about so he would have no control in my life or my children’s lives, or have any hold on us whatsoever. Forgiveness is peace, really.”</p>
  <p>—Rev. Anthony Thompson</p>
