<p>Mike Williams of <em>The Why Factor</em> on BBC Radio took a deep and well-rounded look at forgiveness in this excellent episode from 2016. </p>

<p>The episode focuses on the stories of Madeline Black, who was brutally raped by two teenage boys at age 13; Sarah Heatley, whose husband murdered their two children as a way to punish her for splitting up; and Kemal Pervanic, whose teacher became his torturer in the Omarska concentration camp during the Bosnian war. </p>

<p>It also features one of the world’s preeminent forgiveness researchers, Dr. Robert Enright, who covers the psychological process of forgiveness, and historian of religion Martin Palmer, who talks about the role of forgiveness in religions around the world.</p>

<p>It’s a great listen, try it now.</p>
