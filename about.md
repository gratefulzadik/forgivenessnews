<p>The mission of the Forgiveness News Network is to build a more forgiving world by sharing stories and discussions of forgiveness in life, the news, and popular culture.</p>

<p>We believe that forgiveness in the right measure, at the right time, enhances health, creates opportunities for growth in individuals as well as communities and nations, and reveals our most deeply held values. Forgiveness News Network provides opportunities to learn how the process of forgiveness unfolds in the lives of real people around the world, as well as in popular culture. We want the process of forgiveness to be familiar to everyone, so that no one need ever say, “I want to forgive, but I don’t know how.”</p>

<p>The Forgiveness News Network logo is based on the yin-yang symbol. Within every transgression there are two perspectives: that of the person suffering the transgression and that of the person, institution, or force which caused the transgression. Each plays some part in the wholeness of the other. So long as we only experience one of these perspectives, we have much to learn from the other, until we realize we are at one with all human beings who have suffered...that is, with all human beings. The logo smiles innocently despite the prevalence of suffering, because where there is learning, there is healing, and where there is healing, there is joy.</p>
